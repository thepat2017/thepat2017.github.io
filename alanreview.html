<h1>GameLord's Den</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to the GameLord's Den! My name is Alan Jerry, and I write my reviews of video games here. The site is currently under construction, but you can expect to see me update it with tons of game reviews as the years go by!
I hope you enjoy this site as much as I do! Much love from me and my family to you and yours! - Alan, December 25th, 1997.</p>
