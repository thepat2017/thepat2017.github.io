<p>PINK ROOM DELIGHT</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>The Plot</h2>
<p>Pink Room Delight is an interesting video game. The game takes place all within one room, and the plot is kind of convoluted and doesn't make a lot of sense, but it really just is the background part because mainly 
players are there for the fun puzzle solving gameplay. I will talk about that gameplay more in the Gameplay section of the review. The plot itself is about people who are locked in the Pink Room because the room looks kind
of pink, and you need to escape it by solving puzzles set up by the evil man. At the end of the game, the evil man tries to do something super dangerous. The game has multiple endings, one where the people just give up and
they are allowed to get out anyways because it's all just a game, and the other ending they succeed and escape the correct way.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Characters</h2>
<p>The characters are a group of friends who are in the room and need to get out. I don't know a lot about them. Sorry LOL. Maybe you know them more than I do.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Gameplay</h2>
<p>I will not spoil the gameplay or tell you anything you can do in this section of the review, you should solve the puzzle for yourself. However, feel free to browse my website for motivaiton if you feel stuck while trying to
solve something!</p>

<p>I give Pink Room Delight a 10/10. Another Nintendo 64 Winning game.</p>
