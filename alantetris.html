<p>A retro review of tetris</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>The Plot</h2>
<p>Traditionally, tetris games do not have reviews, and this is on purpose I think. I think that the developers do not want you to get so worried about the plot and everything, so there isn't a strong story in the games. That being said,
I like to make up my own story when it comes to the tetris game. I personally believe that all of the blocks are alive, and the game takes place in a purgatory dimension where the player is an angel, and the blocks are people being
set up to enter an eternal paradise, but in order to do so they must all be lined up and then thats when they dissapear from your game and they get to go to heaven. If the player does not win the game and loses, the blocks are unhappy, but they
are not stuck forever and can still be saved, as the next game is just your next attempt and the same blocks will actually come through and get a chance to go to the heaven dimension.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Characters</h2>
<p>The main character is THe Angel, who sends the blocks to heaven by lining them up properly. All of the blocks are shaped certain ways depending on what sins they have committed, but you send them places and line them up well, and in doing so
you forgive them (it is is similar to the real life Jesus Christ bible story). The long block is the least sinner, and the ones that are kind of Z shaped are the most sinners, but if you do your job right, they understand
what they did wrong and fizzle away, and get to go be happy with their families. It is really beutiful.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Gameplay</h2>
<p>The gameplay of Tetris involves lining up blocks and trying to organize them so they all line up and you don't have any gaps left over. If you run out of room for more blocks, you lose and must restart. It is simple but endlessly replayable.
I think it's one of the best games of our generation, and for generations to come.</p>

<h2>Final Score</h2>
<p>I give Tetris a 7/10. Another Nintendo 64 Winning game.</p>

<h3>Comments:</h3>
<p class="comments"> King Chip: Did you see about the AI online that they tought to play Tetris, and it paused the game? What does that mean o_O? Is it a part of the story?</p>
<p class="comments"> ADMIN: Yes, I think the AI knows something about tetris that maybe we don't know and it's cool to think about that. I think it also has implications for the future of artificial intelligence. We as a people need to make sure we develop things the right way, and don't abuse our power! </p>
