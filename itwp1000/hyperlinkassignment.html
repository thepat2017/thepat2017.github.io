<h2>Stairway to Heaven Lyrics</h2>

<i>by Led Zeppelin</i>
<br>

<p>
<a id="v1"></a>There's a lady who's sure<br>
All that glitters is gold<br>
And she's buying a stairway to heaven<br>
When she gets there she knows<br>
If the stores are all closed<br>
With a word she can get what she came for<br>
Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to heaven
</p>

<p>
<a id="v2"></a>There's a sign on the wall<br>
But she wants to be sure<br>
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings<br>
In a tree by the brook<br>
There's a songbird who sings<br>
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving
</p>

<p>
<a id="v3"></a>Ooh, it makes me wonder<br>
Ooh, it makes me wonder
</p>

<p>
<a id="v4"></a>There's a feeling I get<br>
When I look to the west<br>
And my spirit is crying for leaving<br>
In my thoughts I have seen<br>
Rings of smoke through the trees<br>
And the voices of those who standing looking
</p>

<p>
<a id="v5"></a>Ooh, it makes me wonder<br>
Ooh, it really makes me wonder
</p>

<p>
<a id="v6"></a>And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune<br>
Then the piper will lead us to reason<br>
And a new day will dawn<br>
For those who stand long<br>
And the forests will echo with laughter
</p>

<p>
<a id="v7"></a>If there's a bustle in your hedgerow<br>
Don't be alarmed now<br>
It's just a spring clean for the May queen<br>
Yes, there are two paths you can go by<br>
But in the long run<br>
There's still time to change the road you're on<br>
And it makes me wonder
</p>

<p>
<a id="v8"></a>Your head is humming and it won't go<br>
In case you don't know<br>
The piper's calling you to join him<br>
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow<br>
And did you know<br>
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind
</p>

<p>
<a id="v9"></a>And as we wind on down the road<br>
Our shadows taller than our soul<br>
There walks a lady we all know<br>
Who shines white light and wants to show<br>
How everything still turns to gold<br>
And if you listen very hard<br>
The tune will come to you at last<br>
When all are one and one is all<br>
To be a rock and not to roll<br>
And she's buying the stairway to heaven
</p>
