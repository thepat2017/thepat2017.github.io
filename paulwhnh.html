<h2>Wolf House Nut-house is the perfect movie for the Christmas Season and I am tired of pretending it's not.</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>This movie, which takes place in the character Seth's house in the "Wolf Room" is about people on Christmas in their room, but it is also very intense. People say it's not a Christmas movie because it has puzzles, but that is DUMBASS.</p>
