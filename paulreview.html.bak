 <h2>About Me</h2>
 <img src="assets/images/paul.jpg">
 <h3>My name is Paul but you can call me Lovely Paul, as that is my nickname. I am 48 years old, and I have been watching movies all my life. Myfavoritre movies are movies with pirates, or movies that
 have soldiers in them, or comedy movies like Adam Sandler or the Spongebob movie. A lot of people tell me I am the best movie reviewer and have a "wizards eye" for movies, including my friend and colleuge from work,
 Steven Speelberg. Yes I know him and we are friends.
