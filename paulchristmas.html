<p> Charlie Brown Christmas is one of those movies that you have to watch every year.

It might not be the most exciting, but sometimes there are just christmas traditions that

you need to be aware of and this is one of them. The characters, are simple, but fun and relatable.

The story is as old as time, with that dang old tree. And also, Snoopy is fantastic. I don't do this

<h3> 10/10 review.</h3>
<p> That's right! One of my rare Paul Certified 10/10's. I know some people may disagree, and that's fine. As long as you remember it's Christmas and keep that in your heart, I think everything should be perfectly fine. Charlie Brown
himself has a lot to teach you if you are willing to listen, and I think that is just fantastic. For example, this one time, I was going to see my lovely sister who lives in Massachussets, but wouldn't you know it, a homeless man
was on the street there. At first I just looked at him and though "oh boy what is this guy going to want from me" but then I approached him and he looked over at me and just smiled. So I said to him hey what's happening, why are you
smiling and he looked back at me with this kind of face that I've never seen on a human but maybe more like it would be on a wolf or a fox, or some other kind of devious creature that wanted to hurt a baby or a woman in a burning building.
He grinned at me with that look and a chil went down my spine that I swear I have never felt again to this day. I knew he was nefarious or some kind of villain. but instead of punching him or calling the police to have him executed, I simply
said to him "I wish you a goood day' and I continued walking to see my sister. It's lessons like this that the Charlie Brown people want to teach you, and I think that's super beautiful.</p>
