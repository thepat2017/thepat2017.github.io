<h1>Jurassic Park</h1>
<p>One of the best movies my friend has ever made, this one is absolutely a masterpiece. My God was I laughing when I saw the big screen. And also, Merry Christmas very much. I know I said it was Christmas movies, and this maybe isn't exactly one, but it pretty much is, so you know how that goes. Merry Christmas.
The Characters are fantastic, and so are the plot. I think this movie might be a little bit scary for children, so be careful. It's not too bad though. Spoiler alart, the people do not all die and the animals do not all win, so at least the ending is not the worst thing in the world (unlike in superman2) which was bad.
Thanks for reading the review.</p>
